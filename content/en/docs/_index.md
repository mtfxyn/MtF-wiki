Welcome to the {{< mtf-wiki >}}, a place that may help some transgender women.

{{< notice info >}}
Though this site was founded initially for Chinese transgender people, we provide this English page to show our visibility. However, if you would like to contribute information for the transgender people in your region, doing so is always welcomed.
{{< /notice >}}

MtF (Male-to-Female), or transgender female, refers to a female whose gender[^1] was assigned male at birth but is a woman.

{{< mtf-wiki >}} is committed to evolving into a free, open, and constantly updated platform for the integration of transgender knowledge, offering insights into various medical information and daily life guides relevant to transgender individuals and their experiences.

The current {{< mtf-wiki >}} is in its infancy. Various materials may have not been completed, and there may even be some errors. Welcome all enthusiastic sisters to join us [^2] and contribute to the {{< mtf-wiki >}}.

As for the original intention of building this website, in addition to providing a knowledge platform for the majority of MtF groups, it is also eager for others to affirm the setting of gender conversion.

Many materials were referred to in the process of writing this project, and I would like to thank you.
